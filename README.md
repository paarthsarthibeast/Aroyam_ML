# Heart-Readmit-ML
This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart failure readmission using hospital patient data. The process involves data extraction, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.. Our goal is to identify patients who are at high risk of readmission after a heart failure episode, enabling hospitals to provide targeted interventions and improve patient care.

To enhance usability, the project includes a web-based interface built with Streamlit, allowing healthcare providers to input patient data and receive real-time readmission risk predictions. This intuitive interface improves accessibility, making it suitable for both technical and non-technical users.
